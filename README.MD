# MemeMe

"MemeMe" :camera: is a meme-generating app developed as part of the Udacity iOS Development Nanodegree. "MemeMe" allows a user to create their own meme using a new or existing photo and share it (through email, Twitter, text or their preferred method) with friends. This is version 1.0, which allows the user to create a meme and share it, but does not store and save the memes.

## Install

To check out my version of "MemeMe":

1. Clone or download my repository:
` $ https://github.com/ginnypx1/MemeMe.git `

2. Enter the "MemeMe" directory:
` $ cd /MemeMe-master/ `

3. Open "MemeMe" in XCode:
` $ open MemeMe.xcodeproj `

## Instructions

"MemeMe" allows a user to take a new photo or choose an existing photo from their Photo Album. The user can then add text to the photo in top and bottom fields, and can choose between several different meme fonts.

The user can then share :couple: and save their meme by clicking on the **Share** icon in the upper-left-hand corner, which brings up the standard Apple sharing activity view and allows the user to choose text, email, Twitter, etc.

## Upgrades

Please check out my repository **MemeMe2.0** for the updated version that allows the user to store, share and edit saved memes.

In this version, I  added the ability for a user to choose between several styles of font, using a slider controller on the bottom of the meme creation screen. I thought it would be particularly useful for the user to have access to "Star Wars" :boom: and "The Simpsons" :laughing: style fonts.

In the future, I would love to add the ability to choose between several filters for the meme photo.
